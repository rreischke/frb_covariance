This code implements the covariance induced by the large-scale structure (LSS) of the observed Dispersion Measure (DM) for a list of FRBs with observed redshift and position on the sky.

## Documentation, Installation and Examples
You can simply clone the directory
```shell
git clone git@github.com:rreischke/frb_covariance.git
```
and then 
```shell
cd frb_covariance
pip install .
```
In the file ``/testtest_covariance.ipynb`` you find a small script on how to run the code. If you use the code, please cite [the Paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.2237R/abstract).
